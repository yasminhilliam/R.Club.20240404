Rigorous controls are an important aspect of all scientific experiments and microbiome analyses are no different. Environmental and extraction controls allow us to identify any contaminants introduced during sample collection, DNA extraction, library preparation, or sequencing. This week, we will learn how to use R package ‘decontam’ to statistically classify contaminants in microbiome data based on frequency and prevalence in low DNA-concentration samples and negative controls.
